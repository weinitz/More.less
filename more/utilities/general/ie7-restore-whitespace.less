// IE7 likes to collapse whitespace on either side of the inline-block elements.
// Ems because we're attempting to match the width of a space character. Left
// version is for form buttons, which typically come after other elements, and
// right version is for icons, which come before. Applying both is ok, but it will
// mean that space between those elements will be .6em (~2 space characters) in IE7,
// instead of the 1 space in other browsers.
